<h1>About Us</h1>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>
	<a href="https://www.midwestkendofederation.org/">Midwest Kendo Federation (MWKF)</a>
	which is the regional chapter under the
	<a href="https://www.auskf.org/">All United States Kendo Federation (AUSKF)</a>, the national
	governing body for Kendo in this country. The MWKF is responsible for all Kendo clubs and Dojos in
	the Midwest area.
</p>

<h2>Motto</h2>
<p>
	Our club motto reads "Shin Gi Ittai", which translates approximately to "The Spirit and Skill are
	One Body" or "The Heart and Technique are Together". This motto was one of several proposed by
	Masaki Hori in the fall of 2004, and was chosen by our club officers and coaches to best represent
	the ideals we strive for in our club. The motto was brushed by Cheng Xin Liu (b. 1943) for our
	club and subsequently updated by Wan Li Hsu for screen print use. This motto is on our club
	tenugui, which is traditionally given to club members before their first competition as a sign of
	mutual support and encouragement.
