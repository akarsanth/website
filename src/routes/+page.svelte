<h1>Welcome to Kendo Club!</h1>

<h2>What is Kendo?</h2>
<p>
	Kendo is a Japanese martial art which literally translates to “The Way of the Sword”. It's an
	athletic sport which is played by means of one-on-one striking between opponents using shinai
	(sword made from bamboo slats) while wearing kendo-gu (protective armor).

<h2>Who are we?</h2>

Kendo Club at the University of Michigan is led by students and instructed by highly experienced
coaches. Our purpose is to provide an open and inviting opportunity for University of Michigan
students and local community members to learn and practice Kendo. We invite everyone of any skill
level to join us!

<h2>How do you join?</h2>

<h3>Come to practice!</h3>
<ul>
	<li>
		You may join any practice session you like (though you may find it easier to join closer to the
		beginning of a new semester, as there are larger groups of complete beginners).
	</li>
	<li>Find our up-to-date practice schedule in the <a href="/calendar">Calendar</a> page.</li>
	<li>
		Please wear comfortable athletic clothes. Wear bottoms that cover the knee because there is some
		kneeling involved. Kendo is a barefoot sport, so please leave your shoes outside the ballroom
		before entering.
	</li>
	<li>Masking is optional. Surgical or cloth masks are the best choices for breathability.</li>
</ul>
