<h1>Welcome to Kendo Club!</h1>

<h1>What is Kendo?</h1>
Kendo is a Japanese martial art which literally translates to “The Way of the Sword”. It's an athletic
sport which is played by means of one-on-one striking between opponents using shinai (sword made from
bamboo slats) while wearing kendo-gu (protective armor).

		<li>
			You can come to any practice session you like (though you may find it easier to join closer to
			the beginning of a new semester).
		</li>
		<li>
			Please wear comfortable athletic clothes. Bottoms that cover the knee are preferred because
			there is some kneeling involved. This is a barefoot sport, so please leave your shoes outside
			the ballroom before entering.
		</li>
		<li>Masking is optional. Surgical or cloth masks are the best choices for breathability.</li>
