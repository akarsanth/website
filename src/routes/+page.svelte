<h1>Welcome to Kendo Club!</h1>

<h1>What is Kendo?</h1>
Kendo is a Japanese martial art which literally translates to “The Way of the Sword”. It's an athletic
sport which is played by means of one-on-one striking between opponents using shinai (sword made from
bamboo slats) while wearing kendo-gu (protective armor).

<h1>How do you join?</h1>

<h3>Come to practice!</h3>
<ul>
	<li>
		You may join any practice session you like (though you may find it easier to join closer to the
		beginning of a new semester, as there are larger groups of complete beginners).
	</li>
	<li>Find our up-to-date practice schedule in the "Calendar" page.</li>
	<li>
		Please wear comfortable athletic clothes. Wear bottoms that cover the knee because there is some
		kneeling involved. Kendo is a barefoot sport, so please leave your shoes outside the ballroom
		before entering.
	</li>
	<li>Masking is optional. Surgical or cloth masks are the best choices for breathability.</li>
